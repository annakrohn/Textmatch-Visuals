I sing of arms and the man, he who, exiled by fate,  
first came from the coast of Troy to Italy, and to  
Lavinian shores hurled about endlessly by land and sea,  
by the will of the gods, by cruel Junoâ€™s remorseless anger,  
long suffering also in war, until he founded a city  
and brought his gods to Latium
